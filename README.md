# myreminder
## Online calendar website to help you keep track of your notes & tasks

I built myreminder in 2020 when I was experimenting with JavaScript's LocalStorage. Myreminder can create, edit, delete the notes you wrote.
## Functionality â€” How to use:
- Create note: click on the Add button and start writing.
- Edit: right-click on the note you need to edit
- Delete: click on the note to delete it.
